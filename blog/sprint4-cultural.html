            <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
                <p>Understanding neuroplasticity allows people to understand that their intelligence and abilities aren’t fixed in stone. In contrast to believing your capabilities are unable to be changed, neuroplasticity encourages the viewpoint that people can better themselves through practice and reflection. By working harder, we can improve.</p>
                <p>In learning a subject like web development. Understanding neuroplasticity may be immensely helpful, especially seeing as I have little experience in this field. Exposure to complicated topics that require a lot of practice to understand may be off-putting in the beginning, but through taking Dev Academy’s advice and acknowledging that skills take time to build, I can use it to motivate myself in my study. </p>    
                <p>To increase neuroplasticity, I should practice everyday, imagine myself doing so in down-time, and place what I’ve learnt in context through reflections like this. </p>
                <p>I found <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5fn8xOE2Y'>this video on Neuroplasticity</a> to be engaging and convey they points succinctly</p>
            <h4>The Growth Mindset</h4>
                <p>Growth mindset is the antithesis of the fixed mindset. It’s the belief that intelligence can be grown through learning. It is kinda like the opposite of IQ testing of individuals and things like that. </p>

                <p>It is not particularly surprising to me that it is beneficial for students – especially those that are marginalised – to perform better when encouraged and stimulated through positive thinking and alternative learning techniques that challenge the status quo. The TED talk was great, I hope to focus more on this type of thinking myself during foundations and steer away from negative approaches to learning that I have found myself falling into in the past. </p>

                <p>Integrating the growth mindset will be at top of mind for me as I move through my reflections – which I aim to do each day. Hopefully this will keep me on my game when it comes to motivation. </p>


                <p>I enjoyed <a href='https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099'>Carol Dweck's</a> video a lot. </p>
