                <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve learnt that I don’t necessarily have a growth mindset in a way that I thought I might have 
                    – that this is something I definitely need to focus on. Throughout foundations, when I found 
                    myself stressed, I was vulnerable to thoughts that I might just not have the brain for this 
                    type of work and things like that. However, through our reflections I’ve been actively trying 
                    to dismiss assumptions like that and just focus on learning the material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t like to look like I don’t know what I am doing – even when trying something new haha. 
                    I do think that this is probably because the cohort are currently strangers though, I know 
                    I have no trouble asking for help with people I am familiar with.
                </p>
                <p>I can pay attention to work for a lot longer than I thought I could. I’ve spent a lot of time 
                    just struggling with problems during these past few weeks and I’ve never really tried and 
                    failed at anything as much as I have been. 
                </p>

                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    Values, empathy and self awareness all influence how people learn and how they work together. 
                    Programming is a job and with all jobs, you need to be able to work with people and collaborate 
                    to be effective. While the act of coding might seem quite a solitary task, peer reviews and peer 
                    programming are essential in picking up bugs and are used across industries. It’s important for 
                    everyone to learn to work together as this is what real-life is all about. Understanding your 
                    own values, other people’s and having empathy and self-awareness when dealing with others allows 
                    everyone to work at their best and to produce the best work possible. 
                </p>        
                <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    Just how much the content was relevant in the small amount of programming I’ve been doing. 
                    It is very easy to feel disheartened when things are working out or when you’ve been stuck on 
                    something that should be simple for a long time, but taking the advice that was offered in the 
                    core learning modules was really helpful and necessary when tackling the technical challenges. 
                </p>
                <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    Sharing probably. I’m a little reserved so having to express what we’ve been asked to in these 
                    sections and post it in the Slack channels was fairly tough.
                </p>
                <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning 
                    in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                <p>
                    Because it applies to real jobs so much. I think sometimes people might have this idea of 
                    programming as being a solely independent vocation, but when you’re working for anyone you’ll 
                    obviously have to interact a lot and deal with all types of people. I think Dev Academy is 
                    attempting to prepare people for these workplaces.
                </p>
                <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
                    Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>
                    It doesn’t feel like that. The information in the growth mindset modules was really helpful for 
                    me I can totally see how the challenging work might be too much if you didn’t come into it thinking
                     ‘not yet’. It would be very easy to feel like you’re too dumb to do it.
                </p>
                <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>
                    I would still like to work in UX design, it’s a topic that I find extremely interesting and 
                    actually researching it more during foundations has made it seem more appealing.
                </p>
                <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think my biggest strengths will be that I am independent and I will take responsibility for 
                    my own learning and tasks. My limitations will still likely be that I am shy, I don’t want to 
                    hold anyone back so I probably don’t ask questions to others when I should.
                </p>
                <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>        
                <p>
                    Pretty similar to above. I’m a bit worried about peer programming as I would find it difficult 
                    if I was a lot worse than the other person and they were held up because of me. I’m pretty 
                    nervous about that situation coming up haha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking in front of people would definitely be difficult but I really want to get better at it 
                    so I’m ready to attempt it more.
                </p>
                <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
                <p>
                   Speaking in front of people, confidence and collaborating. I want to train myself to not be so 
                   nervous in these situations and to put my best self forward, I think the best way to do it is 
                   to expose myself to this in new environments and not avoid it!
                </p>
                <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>
                    To be present, on time, focused and committed always. I want to get the most out of this as 
                    I possibly can so I need to ensure I am taking advantage of every opportunity to learn even 
                    if I am uncomfortable.
                </p>
