                <h3>When I got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
                <p>
                During the FizzBuzz (Super Edition) Kata, I found myself blocked
                when working out how to find multiples! This was a small part of the overall
                challenge but ended up taking me a substantital amount of time
                to figure it out. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I ended up Googling this particular problem and I found a forum
                that directed me to use the modulo operator, which was very helpful
                from there out.
                </p>
                <p>
                I felt frustrated as I knew this was a small part of the challenge, and
                once I discovered the answer I felt like I should've known it from 
                the get-go. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I learnt that it is sometimes the unexpected that will trip you
                up in a problem, and that it is important to plan out your code before
                getting started. In trying to solve this before Googling, I had made quite
                a mess so my code was looking very muddled and confusing – cleaning it up
                helped me get into a better state of mind.
                </p>


                <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>

                <p> 
                I think that my most elegant problem solving came when I was working on
                the Gradebook Kata. This wasn't because I instantly knew what to do 
                or anything, but because I wrote out pseudocode to plan out my answers
                and was able to identify parts of the solution that I needed to research
                in order to be able to write. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Throughout this stage I felt pretty confident (that changed again quickly) 
                but, it was great to be able to apply the techniques recommended
                to us and see them work in action. I learnt how useful pseudocode is in 
                drawing out a plan of attack and how it can help you identify areas that
                you're unsure about before you even start writing any syntax.
                </p>

                <h3>Confidence in problem solving techniques</h3>

                <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
                <h5>7/10</h5>
                <p>
                I'm fairly confident when using pseudocode – as long as I have understood
                the problem correctly. This is usually my go-to when planning out
                how to tackle the challenge at hand.
                </p>
                <h4>Trying something</h4>
                <h5>6/10</h5>
                <p>
                I definitely try a lot of thing when working on challenges, their effectiveness
                may leave a little bit to be desired but I'm happy to give trying things
                a go. 
                </p>
                <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
                <h5>2/10</h5>
                <p>
                I haven't reeeally put much effort into trying this one. I do tend to
                read questions outloud and try to articulate what the code is doing
                to better understand it though.
                </p>
                <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
                <h5>5/10</h5>
                <p>
                    I've found the error messages really helpful when picking up syntax errors, 
                    but that's probably the only extent that I have used them to help
                    me solve the challenge.
                </p>
                <h4>Console.logging</h4>
                <h5>7/10</h5>
                <p>
                Console logging was really helpful in a few of the challenges to gain an 
                understanding of why certain tests were failing. I used it quite a lot in the 
                built-in methods Kata.
                </p>
                <h4>Googling</h4>
                <h5>9/10</h5>
                <p>
                Googling would probably be my preferred method of problem solving. 
                I've found it really helpful in a lot of situations, especially when using
                the recommended resource sites and forums. Combining this with pseudocode was
                really useful when encountering techniques I hadn't been exposed to before.
                </p>
                <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
                <h5>3/10</h5>
                <p>
                I haven't yet done this with the cohort, but I know I need to start. I found other
                people's questions and answers really helpful. I am just slightly
                wary about holding anyone up, so I tend to try everything else before doing this.
                </p>
                <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
                <h5>5/10</h5>
                <p>
                Similar with the peers, I know I need to do this more because I know it will
                help me a lot with understanding concepts. I do feel confident doing this, but 
                I should prioritise it more.
                </p>
                <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
                <h5>7/10</h5>
                <p>
                Reflecting on how I've approached problems and how my technique can be improved
                has been great in getting me to see where I could've avoided errors and
                what I should reach for first when encountering issues. I definitely want to 
                do this more as I've experienced how helpful it is this week.
                </p>
