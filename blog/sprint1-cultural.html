        <h4>Exploring the Evidence</h4>
            <h5>Self-Evaluation</h5>
            <p>My Values</p>
            <p>
                In reflection, I would consider myself to be a connection-orientated person that primarily prioritises 
                self-care in order to be helpful and present with the important people and moments in my life. 
            </p>
            <p>As such, I believe these five values are most central to who I am:</p>
            <h4>Resourcefulness</h4>
            <p>
                I think it‚Äôs crucial for myself and others to be resourceful and independent. For me, resourcefulness 
                is the ability to adapt to change and to develop the means for resilience in all situations possible.
            </p>
            <h4>Health</h4>
            <p>
                As the cheesy quote goes, ‚Äúhealth is wealth‚Äù. Health is important to me because it influences almost 
                every aspect of a person‚Äôs life. If someone isn‚Äôt health (whether mentally or physically), they won‚Äôt be 
                the best they can be.
            </p>
            <h4>Fun</h4>
            <p>
                I don‚Äôt think life would be worth living if there weren‚Äôt any fun parts. I definitely take fun seriously 
                and make time for it every day.
            </p>
            <h4>Openness</h4>
            <p>
                I believe people have to be open to new ideas, new experiences, new ways of living and new people. 
                Openness is so essential because if you are closed off the new things then there‚Äôs no way to grow and 
                learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also think that openness is about acknowledging human differences and kinda celebrating that ‚Äì being 
                ready to accept others and see new perspectives (maybe empathy ties into this).
            </p>
            <h4>Sensitivity</h4>
            <p>To me, sensitivity is about being aware of the different experiences everyone has everyday and adjusting 
                your behaviour accordingly. It is also understanding that everyone comes with a story and that your 
                interactions with everyone is based on this. I value my own sensitivity towards other people and 
                others‚Äô sensitivity towards me pretty highly.
            </p>
            <h4>16 Personalities (Myers-Briggs Test)</h4>
            <p>
                I got the INFP-T (Mediator) personality type. This stands for introverted (74%), intuitive (74%), 
                feeling (53%), prospecting (64%), and turbulent (72%)
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the headings for this personality type is ‚ÄúListen to Many People, Talk to Few‚Äù which I identify 
                with quite a bit.
            </p>
            <h4>Culture's influence on values and identity.</h4>
            <p>I believe that the openness of the majority of New Zealanders has greatly impacted my values and identity. 
                With the opportunity to make friends with, study with, work with, and flat with, so many different types of 
                people from so many different backgrounds, there is the opportunity to explore and learn so many different 
                ways of living. And open-minded approach to the world and people is one of my core values and what I value 
                in others. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I am also from a large family (four siblings) which I believe developed my independence and resourcefulness. 
            </p>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I‚Äôm open-minded</li>
                <li>Goal-driven</li>
                <li>Calm</li>
                <li>Independent</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Shy (NERVOUS talking in front of people)</li>
                <li>Reserved</li>
                <li>I can lose confidence quickly 
                </li>
                <li>I can be too idealistic with goals and plans.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Strengths and limitations with Dev Academy and my Career</h4>
            <p>
                The idea of Sprints and the ‚Äòjust in time‚Äô learning model works very well with my strengths of being 
                independent and working towards goals. I enjoy the satisfaction of achieving work in small bites, so 
                having modules for each piece of information is something I enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because I am goal-driven and my current goal is to become a web developer and change my career path, 
                I would hope to maintain motivation throughout the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of limitations, for me this would most likely come into play during activities like this and 
                in times where I may need to speak in front of people. I find it very difficult to do this around 
                strangers and it takes me a while to get used to people. I will likely struggle if we have presentations 
                or anything like that during bootcamp üôÇ
            </p>
            <h4>Example of Work Conflict</h4>
            <p>In my last job, after one of my team members left the company, their replacement was not quite as good at 
                their job. I ended up being responsible for training them which was a new experience for me. 
                While at the time, it did not seem like they were putting much effort into improving and seemed to be 
                relying on me to fix up their mistakes, when I got frustrated I would think back to how I felt starting a 
                new job and the silly things I did when I was new ‚Äì that really helped me to be more understanding and 
                enthusiastic about training. 
            </p>
            <h4>Ethical Decision</h4>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm going to continue with the new employee story because it is fresh in my mind and I can draw quite a 
                bit from it!
            </p>
            <p>
                While training the new team member I was also tasked with reporting back to the managers how things were 
                going and all of that. The team member took quite a while to get the hang of the responsibilities 
                they had, as a result this caused a lot of extra work for me. Not only this, but I was also aware that 
                they were earning a significant amount more than me for a lot less work. As a result, the combination of 
                these things made it very tempting to complain about their progress. I had very little job satisfaction 
                during this period and it was hard to stay motivated.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I was to complain to management, there would be the possibility that the team member‚Äôs job might be on the line as they were still within the trial period and my workplace wasn‚Äôt the most nurturing of its kind. I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt say this was on my mind a few times, but in the end I of course didn‚Äôt choose to go down that road ‚Äì which I‚Äôm very happy about. As a result, the team member ended up learning and gaining more independence in the role. While they probably took up a position they shouldn‚Äôt have, I‚Äôm sure it was beneficial for them in the long-run (and me) and I was glad to be able to help someone improve</p>
            <p>
                I think this played into my values of resourcefulness, openness and sensitivity. I was sensitive to 
                the individual needs of the person and open to the possibilities of growth ‚Äì for them and me. 
                I definitely learned a lot about patience and training people.
