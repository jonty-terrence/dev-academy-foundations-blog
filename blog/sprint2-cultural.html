        <h4>Career path</h4>
                <p>
                    In the future I’m aiming to work as a UX designer or front-end developer for some sort of company that creates interesting software, 
                    websites or products and services. I’m pretty broad with my goals at this point, because the specific 
                    business or industry is not so important – I’m more focused on the actual responsibilities, culture 
                    (and maybe pay rate) of the place I work in.
                </p>
                <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
                <p>
                    The most important skill I’d like to work on is my ability to learn. I’m thankful that Dev Academy is 
                    placing so much emphasis on this and that they’re providing techniques and strategies to help. I think 
                    that practicing learning will help me in so many ways and further my skills in all areas.
                </p>
                <h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h4>
                <p>
                    I’d say that my strengths are that I’m open-minded, goal-driven and independent. I think that these 
                    traits will help me navigate the Dev Academy bootcamp because I’m happy to take responsibility for 
                    myself and my own progress. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     My limitations are possibly that I have little experience with coding and when frustrated in other areas 
                     I have a tendency to want to give up when things seem impossible. However, I know that with the right 
                     thought processes I can avoid these negative feelings when I’m struggling and reach out for help 
                     instead. 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
                    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I plan to understand what’s required of each section of the course early, so that I can know what I need 
                    to get out of a module sooner. From this, when I am struggling I will seek assistance at the 
                    appropriate times with my course facilitators. I am already keeping a list of questions as I 
                    maneuver through content and if I can’t figure it out myself in independent research, I have been 
                    asking questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of working productively, I am quite experienced with working independently and working from home 
                    so I don’t really see this being an issue – I have my workspace and schedule etc. While I can be prone to 
                    distractions, I think understanding the course expectations and curriculum each week will prevent me from 
                    putting things off and keep me on track. 
                </p>
                <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
                <p>
                    From the facilitation team, all I’d expect is that they are available and responsive when needed 
                    (within working hours of course). 
                </p>
                    <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I really do value a healthy work/life balance, so although I understand the heavy workload 
                        that bootcamp throws at students, I’m going to continue a few aspects of my routine to 
                        maintain sanity and happiness. I will keep exercising each day, eating properly and 
                        some sort of socialisation each week (post-COVID-19 :)). 
                    </p>
